Looking at the React documentation (at the time of writing), the first example we find shows us how to define components using React.createClass.
Let's start with a very simple snippet:
   const Button = React.createClass({
     render() {
       return <button />
     },
})
We can run the code everywhere without needing to use Babel for transpiling, which is a good way to start with React, avoiding the effort of learning different tools in the React ecosystem.
